        <h1>These are most of the hotels in Grand Cayman that are worth visiting if your staying, or you are a tourist.</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First hotel we have in store is the Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa. This is a great hotel because its rated.... 5 stars. Very interesting hotel.    </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Secondly, we have the Ritz - Carlton. The Ritz - Carlton is a nice hotel with a tennis court, helipad, and so much more. But it is quite expensive. It is worth the money if your visiting.    </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Then we have Palm Heights. 4.8 Star hotel with pools and every thing you would need for your stay. I have never been here so try it out for yourself!    </strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Westin Is a great hotel as it has a gym, beach, pool, and a mini bar! What else could you ask for?    </strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Morrits has a way to make visitors come back to their hotel for over 30 years. Located in the laid-back cultural district of East End, Morritt's is a unique property that is a relaxing retreat from the fast pace of life. Here you will find a peaceful haven with white sand beaches and spectacular ocean views, along with some of the world's best scuba diving and snorkelling. With on-site pools, restaurants, spa, and access to a variety of watersports activities    </strong></li>
            <li><strong>The cheapest hotel I could find was for 197 dollars. Yea, not the best. But there are more options.    </strong></li>
